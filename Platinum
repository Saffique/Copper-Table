The script will create a rollable table named "Wild Magic Surge" with all 50 possibilities.
You can of course use this script to create other rollable tables, all you have to do is to replace the values in the rows variable.
You can also define a weight for each possibility by including a weight property like this:
{ name: "Some name here", weight: 2 }
